      <p class="white-text modalText">This foundation has been created in loving Memory of my son, CPL Chad S Wade USMC. Chad was KIA in Afghanistan on December 1, 2010.  The idea for this foundation actually started just as he was preparing to deploy to Iraq in 2009 when I learned for the first time that our Marines had to pay their own way home before and after deployments.  It bothered me so much that I knew then I had to do something, but I didn’t really know what.  When we knew one of his buddies was struggling to get home due to finances and we offered to pay his way, he absolutely would not accept.  He felt it would be a handout and he wasn’t having it.  He, as most, if not all of them are, too proud to accept.  We knew then that we had to find a way to help them without them feeling like it was a hand-out or charity.  Our son was fortunate to have parents blessed enough to be able to help him get home.  When he came home for pre-deployment leave before Afghanistan we had 11 days of heaven with him.    It was absolutely the most amazing time and he spent more time at home with us than with his friends which was amazing all in itself (as most parents understand).  I never dreamed that would be the last time I would see my only child alive, but it was.  It was at that moment that my husband and I began to think about this foundation again and I told him that I felt that Chad’s band of brothers (while they really helped each other in the field) were really going to need their visits back home more than ever now.  They just experienced the worse situation while in combat a Marine/Soldier can experience.  They need to get home to their families and truly start healing.  This is our mission and our goal with this foundation.  We have fundraisers and depend on the kindness and giving of others to raise money to help these men and women get home.  The success we have seen thus far has far surpassed our expectations.  We are a non-profit foundation and have received our 501 C-3 and are anxiously waiting to send another home!  As of January 2016 we have sent 7 service members home and are ready to send more.</p>
